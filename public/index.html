  <h4>What is personality and how do we assess it?</h4>
  <p>Personality refers to the stable characteristics present in individuals which reflect their predilections to behavior, feeling, thought, and interactions. Its assessment encompasses the measurement of key identity traits which are defined by the type of analysis the assessment is attempting to perform. This would often include testing methods such as interviews, self-reports, performance-based testing, and different observational methods. Our solution attempts to evaluate personality based on a self-report style questionnaire which gauges a personâ€™s behaviors, feelings, thoughts, and coping strategies. After completing this survey, we suggest visiting our informational pages to learn more about your results and reviewing our suggestions for activities, destinations, and jobs that would align with your core characteristics.  

Please note Personalcity does not supply a certified assessment and the results do not reflect verified medical analysis nor do they replace medical diagnostics. Results should not be used in an official capacity. </p>
